# Prediction of Lung Cancer using Artificial Neural Networks
The main idea of the project is to help a potential cancer patient by giving him/her the risk percentage to be diagnosed with lung cancer, so that he can change his lifestyle accordingly and avoid cancer. This system can be used by hospitals to help such potential patients by giving them treatment and proper advice before they are diagnosed with cancer.
